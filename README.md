# Code-Review

In this repository, I will review your code, Fix errors and bugs, give you suggestions and help you with your coding problems.
Ask all your questions in the (https://github.com/7Ragnarok7/code-review/issues)[Issues] section. Categorize your issue using one of these lables: ***Code-Review, Bug, help-wanted, Problems or Suggestions*** 

Clearly describe your problem in the issue description.
I may not check the issue if it is too vague. So be specific and clear.
In the issue description, you can either post the link to the code in your github repo on which you need help or you can directly post a portion of the code in which you need help.

If you post the link to the code in your github repo, I will make a pull request to your repository with appropriate changes.

### Notice :-

- Your code will be reviewed on basis of First come, First served.
- Have patience if you are on bottom of the list.
